# Genomic Model Evaluation API

### API Reference

This Application Programming Interface (API) was designed for the functional genomics community to create seamless communication across pre-trained models and genomics datasets. It is a product of the feedback from many model and dataset experts and our hope is that it allows for long-lasting benchmarking of models. Models and datasets communicate via a set of predefined protocols through APIs. The common protocol enables any model to communicate with any dataset (although not all combinations may make sense).

The evaluators (dataset APIs) will make prediction requests in the standard format (seen below) to the predictors (model APIs), which then return the predictions to the evaluator in a standard format, enabling the evaluators to calculate the model’s performance.

The communication protocol below covers the mandatory parameters required for the API but users are able to add more parameters/functions.

For our efforts to succeed we require community support and feedback from data and models experts so that the design will result in a stable long-term solution for model benchmarking. Since dataset creators are the experts in their dataset, they are most qualified to decide how these models should be evaluated on their data. Meanwhile, model creators are best qualified for deciding how the model should be used for the inference tasks. Accordingly, the responsibilities for adding the new datasets and models would fall on their creators. Being able to easily compare results across different datasets and models would accelerate the improvement of genomics models, motivate novel functional genomic benchmarks, and provide a more nuanced understanding of model abilities.

If you would like to be involved we encourage you to use this communication protocol with your own models and datasets and submit to the Github repo list (add link). If you have critiques or feedback please reach out to [ishika.luthra\@ubc.ca](mailto:ishika.luthra@ubc.ca)

Example of containers for evalutors, predictors and scripts for communication can be found in the `examples` folder.

Add a little blurb about .json formatting.

Any evaluator can retrieve information from a predictor by asking for `help` in the `task` key. This will return a `.json` file that is written by predictor builders. The keys attached below are mandatory for the communication

Message sent by evalutor:

### Error messages

Error messages that should be returned by the predictors in .json format. Error messages should be returned via one of the 3 possible keys so that the evaluators can "catch" the exception. Values can follow the format described below (any type) or other/additional ones can be added by the predictor builders.

We encourage predictor builders to return error messages in the format show below. Helper functions that have some basic error catching to build off can be found in the `src` folder.
